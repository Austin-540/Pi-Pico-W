# Pi-Pico-W

Some micropython scripts I wrote to run on my Raspberry Pi Pico W

I'm trying to use every component that came with my components kit. Here's my progress:



✅ LEDs  
✅ RGB LED  
❌ Photoresistor  
❌ Thermistor  
❌ Diode Rectifier (1N4007)  
❌ NPN Transistor (PN2222)  
❌ IC 4N35  
❌ IC 74HC595  
✅ Button (small)  
✅ Active Buzzer  
❌ IR Receiving Head  
❌ Flame sensor  
✅ Precision Potentiometer  
❌ 22pf Ceramic Capacitor  
❌ 104 Ceramic Capacitor  
❌ Electrolytic Capacitor (10UF 50V)  
❌ Electrolytic Capacitor (100UF 50V)  
✅ Resistors
